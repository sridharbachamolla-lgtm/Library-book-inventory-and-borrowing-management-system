# Problem Statement #ProblemStatement
Manual record-keeping in libraries leads to lost data, slow book tracking, limited accuracy, and inefficient handling of borrowing and returning transactions. The absence of automation causes difficulties in updating book inventory, searching for titles, and monitoring usage, resulting in customer inconvenience and increased staff workload. #LibraryProblems #AutomationNeeded
